\usage{
alpaca.RotationAnalysis.Louvain(net.table)
}
\arguments{
\item{net.table}{A table of edges, with the first column representing the TFs ("from" nodes) and the second column representing the targets ("to" nodes). The third column contains the edge weights corresponding to the control or healthy network, and the fourth column contains the edge weights for the disease network or network of interest.}
}
\value{
Vector of nodes ordered by how much they change their community membership between the two networks.
