\usage{
panda.to.alpaca(panda_net1, panda_net2, file.stem = "./alpaca",
  verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{panda_net1}{Data Frame indicating one entire network generate by \code{\link{panda}}}

\item{panda_net2}{Data Frame indicating another entire network generate by \code{\link{panda}}}

\item{file.stem}{The folder location and title under which all results will be stored.}

\item{verbose}{Indicates whether the full differential modularity matrix should also be written to a file. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A string message showing the location of output file if file.stem is given, 
       or a List where first element is the membership vector and second element is the contribution score of each node to its module's total differential modularity
}
\description{
\strong{ALPACA}(ALtered Partitions Across Community Architectures) is a method for comparing two genome-scale networks derived from different phenotypic states to identify condition-specific modules.
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-018-0052-5}{[(Padi and Quackenbush 2018)])}
This function compares two networks generate by \code{\link{panda}} in this package and finds the sets of nodes that best characterize the change in modular structure.
