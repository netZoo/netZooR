\arguments{
\item{averageSims}{The average similarities for the in-groups and out-groups.
This is a FERRET_Similarities object.}

\item{lowestSims}{The lower boundary for the curve. This is a FERRET_Similarities object.}

\item{highestSims}{The upper boundary for the curve. This is a FERRET_Similarities object.}

\item{auc}{This is a total AUC score to include on the curve as text.}

\item{xlab}{This is the label to include on the X axis.}

\item{ylab}{This is the label to include on the Y axis.}

\item{main}{This is the title of the plot.}

\item{absoluteMin}{The absolute minimum similarity in the results.}

\item{absoluteMax}{The absolute maximum similarity in the results.}
}
\value{
Nothing, but generates a plot as a side effect.
