\usage{
puma(
  motif,
  expr = NULL,
  ppi = NULL,
  alpha = 0.1,
  mir_file,
  hamming = 0.001,
  iter = NA,
  output = c("regulatory", "coexpression", "cooperative"),

}
\arguments{
\item{motif}{A miRNA target dataset, a data.frame, matrix or exprSet containing 3 columns.
Each row describes the association between a miRNA (column 1) its target
gene (column 2) and a score (column 3) for the association from TargetScan or miRanda}

\item{expr}{An expression dataset, as a genes (rows) by samples (columns) data.frame}

\item{ppi}{This can be set to 1) NULL which will be encoded as an identity matrix between miRNAs in PUMA for now. 
Or 2) it can include a set of TF interactions, or 3) a mix of TFs and miRNAs.}

\item{alpha}{value to be used for update variable, alpha (default=0.1)}

\item{mir_file}{list of miRNA to filter the PPI matrix and prevent update of miRNA edges.}

\item{hamming}{value at which to terminate the process based on hamming distance (default 10^-3)}

\item{iter}{sets the maximum number of iterations PUMA can run before exiting.}

\item{output}{a vector containing which networks to return.  Options include "regulatory",
"coregulatory", "cooperative".}

\item{zScale}{Boolean to indicate use of z-scores in output.  False will use [0,1] scale.}

\item{progress}{Boolean to indicate printing of output for algorithm progress.}

\item{randomize}{method by which to randomize gene expression matrix.  Default "None".  Must
be one of "None", "within.gene", "by.genes".  "within.gene" randomization scrambles each row
of the gene expression matrix, "by.gene" scrambles gene labels.}

\item{cor.method}{Correlation method, default is "pearson".}

\item{scale.by.present}{Boolean to indicate scaling of correlations by percentage of positive samples.}

\item{edgelist}{Boolean to indicate if edge lists instead of matrices should be returned.}

\item{remove.missing.ppi}{Boolean to indicate whether miRNAs in the PPI but not in the motif data should be
removed. Only when mode=='legacy'.}

\item{remove.missing.motif}{Boolean to indicate whether genes targeted in the motif data but not the
expression data should be removed. Only when mode=='legacy'.}

\item{remove.missing.genes}{Boolean to indicate whether genes in the expression data but lacking
information from the motif prior should be removed. Only when mode=='legacy'.}

\item{mode}{The data alignment mode. The mode 'union' takes the union of the genes in the expression matrix and the motif
and the union of TFs in the ppi and motif and fills the matrics with zeros for nonintersecting TFs and gens, 'intersection' 
takes the intersection of genes and TFs and removes nonintersecting sets, 'legacy' is the old behavior with version 1.19.3.
#' Parameters remove.missing.ppi, remove.missingmotif, remove.missing.genes work only with mode=='legacy'.}
}
\value{
An object of class "panda" containing matrices describing networks achieved by convergence
with PUMA algorithm.\cr
"regNet" is the regulatory network\cr
"coregNet" is the coregulatory network\cr
"coopNet" is the cooperative network which is not updated for miRNAs
}
