\title{Comparing node community membership between two networks}
\usage{
alpaca.CommunityStructureRotation(net1.memb, net2.memb)
}
\arguments{
\item{net1.memb}{The community membership for Network 1.}

\item{net2.memb}{The community membership for Network 2.}
}
\value{
A ranked list of nodes.
}
\description{
This function uses the pseudo-inverse to find the optimal linear transformation mapping the community structures of two networks, then ranks nodes in the network by how much they deviate from the linear mapping.
